This is a practice assignment
I was sitting in front of the TV when I heard the noise
It was a loud 'Bang'.  Like something had hit the house.
The problem wasn't that though.  It was the fact that I was tied to a chair in the house.
That and the smell of smoke.
I'm not really sure which one concerned me the most...
Next the whole house was engulfed in flames.
I had to think fast and find a way to escape.
I was struggling to get out of the chair.
I started coughing because the smoke
